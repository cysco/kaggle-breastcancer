Hello everyone!

This is a program I wrote for studying the Kaggle dataset regarding breast cancer detection/prediction.
You can find a presentation of the problem as well as the dataset at this adress: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

I tried to comment every step so (hopefully!) anyone can follow what happens.
If something seems unclear, please let me know! I'll do my best to complete/improve the explanations.
Same thing goes if you experience issues running the code.

For this first attempt, I focused on two classifiers: Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.
I think the code is flexible enough so you can add new classifiers and toy with them easily.

I wrote a blog article about the analysis, but in French, my native language:

That's it for now. Have fun with data!
